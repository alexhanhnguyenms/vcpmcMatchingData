Remove the WebDAV Publishing feature (via add/remove programs and features -easiest option)
Or, go to Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager, click on the Website where ET exists, 
click "Modules", then select the "WebDAV Publishing" module, and on the right-hand side click the
"Remove" action, to remove the module (this is the better option
if the server is "shared" and being used to host more then just Enterprise Tester).
